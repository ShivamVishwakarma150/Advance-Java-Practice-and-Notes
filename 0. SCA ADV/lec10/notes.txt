EXERCISE
--------

Imagine you have a table called “ALLBOOKS” , with 4 columns 
as “bookid”,”bookname”,”subject” and “bookprice”. The 
table has some records already present in it.

Write an application which updates the price of each JEE book 
in the ALLBOOKS  table by 10%.

At the end also display how many books were updated      


INSERTING  RECORD IN THE RESULTSET
------------------------------------


Insertion of  a row require four steps:

We have to call a method called moveToInsertRow() of ResultSet , it moves the cursor to a special position called “insert row position”.

Add values to a specific column by calling updateXXX() method.

Call the method insertRow() of ResultSet ,so that the changes made are transferred to underlying database.

Call moveToCurrentRow() of ResultSet , so that the cursor moves back to the position where it was before calling moveToInsertRow().
