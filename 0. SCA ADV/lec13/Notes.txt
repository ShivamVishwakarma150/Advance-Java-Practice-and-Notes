INSERTING  IMAGE
================

To insert image in the database we need to take the following steps:

1. Create a table in the database with a column having BLOB  data type

2. Create a File object passing it the image to be inserted as argument

3. Create a FileInputStream object using the File object

4. Both the objects are required because while inserting the image we require an InputStream object representing the image and also size of the image which is  given by File object

5. Call the method setBinaryStream( ) of PreparedStatement object for replacing placeholder of image with actual image object.

6. This method has the following prototype :
	public void setBinaryStream(int pos,InputStream obj,int size) throws SQLException

7. Following is the description of it’s arguments:
	a. 		position of placeholder
	b. 		An object of FileInputStream class holding 			              the image to be inserted.
	c. 		Size of the image in bytes

8.	Finally call the method executeUpdate( ) to insert the image in the database.

EXERCISE
----------
Create a table called MOVIES in the database having following structure:
MOVIES(mov_name varchar2(20),img blob)

Write an app that fetches an image and stores it in the table . Make sure the image name also goes to the “mov_name” column
